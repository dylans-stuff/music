# music
a repo for your music

* basically catalogue all your music in text file / repo style with sources so it can be easily re-downloaded.

* there would be some kind of an update command that would clue you in to any new stuff from the same artists you already follow.  it would check which music you have based on checking your actual music folder, leaving you to actually download the music via any method

* integrate with some kind of package manger, like this: https://github.com/TheFox/mbrew
